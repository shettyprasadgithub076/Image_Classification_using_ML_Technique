# Image Classification using Machine Learning Techniques

This project focuses on implementing various image classification algorithms using machine learning techniques. The algorithms are trained on pixel values as well as feature extraction methods such as Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT), and Speeded-Up Robust Features (SURF). The classification is performed on a dataset containing images of cats and dogs.

## Implemented Algorithms

- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Logistic Regression
- Gradient Descent:
  - Batch Gradient Descent
  - Mini-batch Gradient Descent
  - Stochastic Gradient Descent

## Features

- **Pixel-based Classification**: Training and testing the algorithms using pixel values.
- **Feature Extraction Methods**: Utilizing HOG, SIFT, and SURF feature extraction methods.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Comparing the performance of algorithms trained on pixel values vs. feature-extracted images.
- **Dataset**: Using a dataset containing images of cats and dogs for classification.

## Dataset

The dataset is organized into three main folders:

* training_set: This folder contains images intended for training the models.
* test_set: This folder includes images for testing the trained models.
* unseen_data: Here, you'll find images specifically for evaluating the models on unseen data.
  
Each image in the dataset is categorized into one of two classes: cats or dogs.
